ImageD11
Version 1.7

This is the source code for ImageD11. Probably you wanted a compiled version.


To use it, try this:

 Download and install python 2.7, perhaps from www.python.org 
 Add the packages numpy, matplotlib and pyopengl.

 Then try: 
 python setup.py build
 or
 python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32
 Followed by:
 python setup.py install

After it is installed, you should find a script ImageD11_gui.py, somewhere in your path


Until 2017 this code was mostly developed on sourceforge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/fable/ 

It moves to github.com/jonwright/ImageD11 for a spring clean.


Good luck!
